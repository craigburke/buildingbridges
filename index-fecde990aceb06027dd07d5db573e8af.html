                <h2>About Building Bridges PGH</h2>

                <p>In the wake of a recent local hate crime, a group of concerned Pittsburghers came together to discuss ways to show solidarity with those in the region who are under threat from bigotry.</p>

                <p>Building Bridges PGH is the result of that conversation.</p>

                <p>In discussing options for action, it quickly became clear that a sign campaign would be a concrete way for us to demonstrate our support and make all of our neighbors feel more welcome.</p>

                <p>As Pittsburgh is “The City of Bridges,” it was agreed that the symbol of the bridge would communicate our commitment to connection and inclusion. A local designer, Hilary Schenker of <a href="#">Green Comma Media</a>, lent her talents to creating a sign that delivers an anti-hate message in the city’s own distinctive black and gold. The message, translations, and campaign as a whole represent the efforts of many in our community who are committed to a diverse and united Pittsburgh.</p>

                <h3>Interested in joining us in taking a stand against hate in our region?</h3>

                <p>You can easily show your support by downloading and printing your own copy of the sign to display in your business, home, office, classroom, or community organization. Feel free to print and distribute signs to others as well!  We’re counting on all Pittsburghers who share our values to help spread the message of support and solidarity throughout the region.</p>
