                <h2>About Building Bridges PGH</h2>

                <p>In the wake of a recent local hate crime, a group of concerned Pittsburghers came together to discuss ways to show solidarity with those in the region who are under threat from bigotry.</p>

                <p>Building Bridges PGH is the result of that conversation.</p>

                <p>In discussing options for action, it quickly became clear that a sign campaign would be a concrete way for us to demonstrate our support and make all of our neighbors feel more welcome.</p>

                <p>As Pittsburgh is “The City of Bridges,” it was agreed that the symbol of the bridge would communicate our commitment to connection and inclusion. A local designer, Hilary Schenker of <a href="#">Green Comma Media</a>, lent her talents to creating a sign that delivers an anti-hate message in the city’s own distinctive black and gold. The message, translations, and campaign as a whole represent the efforts of many in our community who are committed to a diverse and united Pittsburgh.</p>
